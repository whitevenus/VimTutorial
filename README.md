## Vim Shortcuts

Vim has three mode: `NORMAL`, `INSERT`, `VISUAL`; In the following key-mappings, `n` stands for `NORMAL` mode, `i` stands for `INSERT` mode, `v` stands for `VISUAL` mode.

**Tips**:

- `<CR>`(Carriage Return) stands for `Enter` keyã€‚
- `[]` means that it can be omitted.
- **Narrow word**: A narrow word is a sequence of letters, numbers, and underscores separated by whitespace characters (such as spaces, tabs, or line breaks)
- **Broad word**: A broad word is a sequence of any non-whitespace
